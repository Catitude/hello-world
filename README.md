Bella's repository for working on Google Code-in 2016 :)

Hi! I'm Bella, an 8th grader in Georgia. I'm interested in things like html, js, and learning more programming languages! All of this is a new experience for me, and I'm really liking it! I also participate in things like robotics and a computer science class.
